%% Conesa & Krueger (1999) - Social Security Reform with Heterogeneous Agents

% Setting transpathoptions.fastOLG equal to one means that the transition path will solve with 'parallelization over (age) j'
transpathoptions.fastOLG=1;
% fastOLG is very fast as it does a lot of parallelization, but it is very
% demanding of hardware, so tends to only be possible for smaller grids.
% But we can slash the memory use by combining it with divide-and-conquer
vfoptions.divideandconquer=1;
vfoptions.level1n=30;


% There are three possible policy reforms, you can choose which one to solve
PolicyReform=1; % 1=Policy Reform A,  2=Policy Reform B,  3=Policy Reform C

% IndivProdShock=2; % 2 for Storesletten et al (1998) the 'symmetric case'
% This example just solves the 'symmetric case' heterogeneity.
% A replication of this paper that does everything can be found at: https://github.com/vfitoolkit/vfitoolkit-matlab-replication/tree/master/ConesaKrueger1999


% Note: CK1999 model can actually be solved without decision variable. (You
% can calculate analytic value for labor supply based on a and aprime, see
% CK1999 paper. I model it explicitly so that code is easier to modify for
% other uses.)
n_d=101; % fraction of time worked
n_a=1001; % assets
N_j=66; % age (number of periods, to be precise this is age-19)

% Note that equation (2.1) of CK1999 includes the conditional probability of survival in the expectations operator.
% In practice/codes it gets included in the discount factor. (This is clearer if you look at their equation (2.4)).

% CK1999 say they set tau=0.107 and b=0.5. Rather than follow this value for tau I treat
% it as a general equilibrium outcome (get a similar value in any case). As an initial 
% guess for tau I use that b=0.5 implies that tau=0.1189. As a double-check
% on the general equilibrium I just include it as part of the calculation
% of general equilibrium, and this can then be compared to the initial guess.
% (is a requirement of general equilibrium that can easily be
% calculated without actually solving model, see CK1999 Section 4 first
% paragraph. They verbally describe how you can relate tau and b from
% equations (2.12) and (2.13), this is implemented in my codes below when I
% set Params.tau_initial). [I also do this as for anything more than a
% flat tax rate this would have to be calculated as part of general eqm.]

% CK1999, when doing the 'symmetric' shocks case say that their Markov is
% approximating an AR(1) plus and iid. This is internally inconsistent with
% the actual model as if it were true then the agent's exogenous state
% should contain each of the AR(1) and the iid seperately as two different
% exogenous states (not just their sum eta). Further calculations suggest 
% that in fact this is not what happened, and CK1999 simply
% set eta in their model equal to exp(z) from equation (4.1) on page 767;
% another way to say this is that eta in equation (4.1) is a completely
% different eta from the eta in the model. Essentially, eta in eqn (4.1) is
% a typo; and exp(z) in eqn (4.1) is what in fact corresponds to eta in the
% model. These codes use exp(z) in eqn (4.1) as the process that is
% approximated to get eta. [Note: This is anyway irrelevant except of the
% results in Table 6.] [What CK1999 do, in ignoring epsilon and using their
% z from eqn (4.1) is standard practice based on an interpretation of the iid
% epsilon as measurement error, it is simply notationally very confusing
% that eta is not eta!.] 

% I do not have their original parameter values for s_j (which CK1999 called psi_j); but they use same source as Imorohoroglu, Imrohoroglu & Joines (1995) and I got IIJ1995 numbers so confident they are correct. 
% Not 100% sure on my epsilon_j, again I use IIJ1995 who used same source. 
% My tau is slightly different (see just above).
