% Cocco, Gomes & Maenhout (2005) - Consumption and Portfolio Choice over the Life Cycle
% This code solves a slightly modified version of this paper (persistent
% shocks instead of permanent shocks, renormalization of the EZ preferences)
%
% Househould chooses a combination of safe and risky asset to save for retirement.
% With exogenous labor risky income can be thought of as a fixed asset.
%
% Labor income risk decreases as people age, which suggests they should switch into 
% riskier assets as they age (their labor income becomes more like a safe asset)
%
% The v shock is markov, so VFI Toolkit calls it an 'z' shock
% The e shock is iid, so VFI Toolkit calls it an 'e' shock
% The eta shock is iid and occurs 'between' periods, so VFI Toolkit calls it an 'u' shock
% To use 'u' shocks we need what VFI Toolkit calls 'Case3' (in Case1 we can choose aprime directly, 
% in Case3 we choose d, and then some iid shock that occurs between periods determines aprime)
%
% This is not the actual model of CGM2005 as there is a minor difference since they use a permanent (unit
% root) shock, whereas I use a markov (a discretized AR(1) process).
% (Actually I ended up using an autocorrelation of 1, so it should be CGM2005 anyway)
%
% Note that using permanent shock v could be treated in a simpler manner (you
% can essentially divide everything by v, see their paper). I don't do this
% as since the paper was published the empirical evidence has become clear
% that it is better modelled as highly persistent, in which case we would
% need the shock to be treated as I do here. Makes it easier to modify :)
%
% I cheat in one place. In retirement CGM2005 freeze the final period
% transitiory iid shock to it's value in the final working period. Because
% this would require me to treat it as a markov, I instead just freeze it
% as zero valued.
%
% I'm guessing that CGM2005 treat the conditional surivival probability in their EZ
% specification as a discount factor? It does not appear to be discussed in article.
